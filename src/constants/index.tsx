    missionStatement:
      "Democracy and egalitarian values cannot be achieved and maintained if countries or communities are mere spectators and renters of the digital world.",

    aboutDescription:
      "Digital Revolution was founded in 2025 by Ramon McDargh-Mitchell to help spread awareness and support underprivileged communities who are left behind in the digital age, and thus have fewer opportunities to succeed in education, careers, and civic participation. The foundation donates 50% of its profits to causes that help address the digital divide and expand access to STEM education opportunities.",

    missionDescription:
      "Our mission is to protect and promote egalitarian democratic values that cannot be achieved or maintained when countries or communities are excluded from the digital age. We believe in universal access to the widespread knowledge of the internet, community ownership of data infrastructure, and the ability to participate in the digital world under self-determined rules and protections. We oppose systems that create digital renters rather than owners, which are inherently oppressive due to their lack of egalitarian rights and dependence on foreign managers whose interests may not align with local communities. By bridging the digital divide, we also create pathways for individuals to access STEM education, coding bootcamps, online learning platforms, and technology careers that were previously out of reach.",

    founderDescription:
      "Ramon McDargh-Mitchell is a technology advocate and digital rights activist with a background in software development, computer science education, and community organizing. With experience in both industry and academia, Ramon has seen how digital inequality creates barriers not just to information access, but to STEM career opportunities and educational advancement. Having witnessed firsthand the growing digital divide in underserved communities, Ramon founded Digital Revolution to bridge the gap between technological advancement and equitable access. Through this foundation, Ramon aims to ensure that technological progress serves humanity's democratic ideals while creating pathways for individuals to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",

    howToSupport:
      "There are many ways to support our mission: shop our newly released products in our store (with 50% of profits going directly to digital equity and STEM education initiatives), make a direct donation to our cause, volunteer with partner organizations working on digital literacy and coding education, mentor individuals pursuing STEM careers, or simply share our mission with others in your community.",
